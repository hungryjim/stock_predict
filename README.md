stock_predict
This project is all about exploring the data of stocks and trying to predict the Adjusted Closing Price of the stocks by analysing the previous Opening price of stock and news related to that stock.
Program Structure:
stock_datasets:
    final_data: the stock and news sentiment socre combianed file generated by Preprocessing_data.py
    raw_price_train: the original stock csv files
    tweet_train: the original tweet files
log: To save the data log of the training I have used the TensorBoard
weights: ModelCheckpoint to store the weights of the model when it has minimum validation loss, just to skip the overfitting
preprocessing_data.py:
    This python file will iterater the original stock and news files to generate final_data
prepare_data_for_madel.py:
    this python file is a kind of tool file for prepare data for model, such as Normalize the stock data
    and develop a function to transform a time series dataset into a supervised learning dataset.
There are two model files:
    benchmark_model.py
    rnn_model.py

how to run this program:
There are two ways to run this application:
    we suggest you run this application through A, because you do not need care about the
    environment and third Python packages
    A, use '*.ipynb' files in colab(https://colab.research.google.com/)
        1, upload the stock_datasets into colab
        2, run the preprocessing_data.ipynb to generator the final_data
        (if you run the preprocessing_data.py in the personal computer, you can upload the final_data file
        directly without run preprocessing_data.ipynb)
        3, run benchmark_model.ipynb for benmark training
        4, before run rnn_simple_train.ipynb, you should init the  parameter of the stock numbuer
         eg: Simple_train_model('1'),Simple_train_model('2')..
         5,before run rnn_framed_train.ipynb, you should init the  parameter of the stock numbuer
         eg: Framed_training('1'), Framed_training('2')
    B, use '.py' files in your personal computer.
       1, Prepare the environments:
            Python Version: 3.x
            install the third Python packages: pandas,numpy,nltk,keras,sklearn and so on
       2ï¼Œrun the preprocessing_data.py for generator the final_data file
       3, run benchmark_model.ipynb for benmark training
       4, before run rnn_simple_train.py, you should init the  parameter of the stock numbuer
         eg: Simple_train_model('1'),Simple_train_model('2')..
       5,before run rnn_framed_train.py, you should init the  parameter of the stock numbuer
         eg: Framed_training('1'), Framed_training('2')
